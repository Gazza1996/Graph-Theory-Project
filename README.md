## Introduction  
My name is Gary Mannion and as part of a Graph Thoery Module based in GMIT I have to design and build a graph database using Neo4J and Cypher. Today Neo4J is the worlds most popular graph database managment system, it uses a language called Cypher as its query language.

The database I'm implementing is supposed to contain data regarding the GMIT timetable for my course. I must have data for Lecturers, rooms, course, module, day, times and groups. In this project I have implemented that data which I will be explaining in more detail later in this documentation.

## What is a Graph Database  
A graph database, also called a graph-oriented database, is a type of NoSQL database that uses graph theory to store, map and query relationships.   

A graph database is essentially a collection of nodes and edges. Each node represents an entity (such as a person or business) and each edge represents a connection or relationship between two nodes. Every node in a graph database is defined by a unique identifier, a set of outgoing edges and/or incoming edges and a set of properties expressed as key/value pairs. Each edge is defined by a unique identifier, a starting-place and/or ending-place node and a set of properties.
