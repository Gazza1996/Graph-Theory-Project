# Neo4j Timetabling Project

## Introduction  
My name is Gary Mannion and as part of a Graph Thoery Module based in GMIT I have to design and build a graph database using Neo4J and Cypher. Today Neo4J is the worlds most popular graph database managment system, it uses a language called Cypher as its query language.

The database I'm implementing is supposed to contain data regarding the GMIT timetable for my course. I must have data for Lecturers, rooms, course, module, day, times and groups. In this project I have implemented that data which I will be explaining in more detail later in this documentation.

## What is a Graph Database  
A graph database, also called a graph-oriented database, is a type of NoSQL database that uses graph theory to store, map and query relationships.   

A graph database is essentially a collection of nodes and edges. Each node represents an entity (such as a person or business) and each edge represents a connection or relationship between two nodes. Every node in a graph database is defined by a unique identifier, a set of outgoing edges and/or incoming edges and a set of properties expressed as key/value pairs. Each edge is defined by a unique identifier, a starting-place and/or ending-place node and a set of properties.

## Neo4j and Cypher  

**Neo4j**  
Neo4j is a graph database management system developed by Neo Technology, Inc. Described by its developers as an ACID-compliant transactional database with native graph storage and processing, Neo4j is the most popular graph database.  

Neo4j is available in a GPL3-licensed open-source "community edition", with online backup and high availability extensions licensed under the terms of the Affero General Public License. Neo also licenses Neo4j with these extensions under closed-source commercial terms.  

Neo4j is implemented in Java and accessible from software written in other languages using the Cypher Query Language through a transactional HTTP endpoint, or through the binary 'bolt' protocol.  

Version 1.0 was released in February 2010.
